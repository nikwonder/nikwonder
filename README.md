# About me
## Introduction
Hiya, I'm NikWonder, a.k.a Nik. My full name's Nikita, and I'm a belarusian programmer.

## Interests
I really like programming. Programming has been my hobby since 6-8 years old, and I still enjoy it. I also enjoy designing and tech stuff.
Out of music I enjoy breakcore, and out of games I enjoy:
- Garry's Mod
- Geometry Dash
- Counter Strike: Source

I also like pizza, and coffee.

## Projects
I had a few projects before GitHub, I think everyone had too. 
Here's a list of them:

- document.ed
- SSBii *(I need a better name I swear)*

And practice projects:

- HTMLTest
- InstallerOnBatch

There are more projects, but they are so simple, that naming them would be a waste of time.
